                Volunteering teaches us life skills and refreshes our perspective, and it’s an experience highly 
                valued by recruiters, student organizations, and other institutions. As a group, we’ve experienced 
                firsthand the impact that serving others can have on us as individuals and as a community. We’ve 
                all volunteered through various organizations and initiatives, but there has been one obstacle: it 
                can be hard to find unique, meaningful volunteering opportunities. Often, this information is buried 
                under pages and pages of search results on Google, and we get limited to what is advertised on campus, 
                etc. Especially in times like these, the need for volunteers is high, but there’s not much consolidated 
                information about how, when, or where to help. Our website aims to be a hub for all things related to 
                serving the community.
